- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and edge cases
- **Test Coverage**: 172 tests with all new features fully tested

### Commands Available
```bash
dayflow auth login/status/logout  # Authentication
dayflow sync                      # Sync calendar events
dayflow note -t "Title"          # Create quick note
dayflow vault setup              # Configure vault
dayflow status                   # System status
dayflow config show/edit         # Configuration
```

## Test Status

### Passing Tests (121/172)
- ✅ All new feature tests (42/42)
  - Daily summary generation (12 tests)
  - Meeting matcher (9 tests)
  - Note command (11 tests)
  - Status command (10 tests)
- ✅ Core functionality tests
- ✅ Basic CLI tests

### Failing Tests (51/172)
- ❌ Vault command tests (configuration isolation issues)
- ❌ Config command tests (file path conflicts)
- ❌ Some integration tests (test environment setup)

## Configuration

Stored in `~/.dayflow/config.yaml`:
```yaml
vault:
  path: /path/to/vault
  locations:
    calendar_events: Calendar Events
    daily_notes: Daily Notes
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Manual Token Workflow**: Due to Mayo Clinic restrictions
2. **Folder-Based Organization**: Works with any vault structure
3. **YAML Frontmatter**: Standard Obsidian metadata format
4. **Wiki Links**: For cross-referencing between notes
5. **Time-Based Meeting Detection**: 15-minute windows for linking

## Next Steps

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned features and timeline.
